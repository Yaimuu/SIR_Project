## Project
### Introduction

This application has been made using the JavaFx librairie : https://openjfx.io/

This project aims to simulate the dynamics of propagation of an epidemic in a population.
Different models are studied to show the differnet parameter's influence on the simulation.

This application offers two different ways to show the propagation :
- A graph, assuming that every person is able to infect every other person 
- A spatialization view, where everyone is showed by a colored circle showing their health state

This project has been inspired by this web page made by a student in mathematics and a researcher engineer working for the CNRS :

### Models
#### SIR Model

SIR Model is the simplest model to describe epidemics. It has been proposed in 1927 in relation with the vaccination health policy against smallpox.

This model sepaates population in three categories :
- **S** : Healthy people
- **I** : Infected people
- **R** : Retired people (Recovered or dead)

Equations defining this model :

![\[\LARGE \begin{cases} \frac{dS(t)}{dt} & = -\beta S(t) I(t)\\ \frac{dI(t)}{dt} & = \beta S(t) I(t) - \gamma I(t)\\ \frac{dR(t)}{dt} & = \gamma I(t) \end{cases}\]
